# Tensorflow-Speech-Commands-Recognition

## What is Speech recognition ?
- Speech recognition is an interdisciplinary subfield of computer science and computational linguistics that develops methodologies and technologies that enable the recognition and translation of spoken language into text by computers with the main benefit of searchability
- In this notebook we are going to develop an Acoustic Model which will be able to classify word utterances into its respective classes
- These models can then be used on sequence of speech audio by using a sliding window to then convert the entire speech into text
